📌 Python Basics: Understanding Data Types
Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! 🚀

📖 Lesson Overview
In this session, I explored one of the most fundamental concepts in Python—Data Types. 
Python provides various built-in data types that help in storing and manipulating different kinds of data.

🔹 Python Data Types
1️⃣ Numeric Types (Numbers)
2️⃣ Boolean Type (True/False)
3️⃣ Text Type (String)
4️⃣ Sequence Types (Ordered Collection)
5️⃣ Set Types (Unordered Collection)
6️⃣ Mapping Type (Key-Value Pair)
7️⃣ Binary Types (For Handling Bytes)


📌 Summary
Numbers: int, float, complex
Boolean: bool
Text: str
Sequence: list, tuple, range
Sets: set, frozenset
Mapping: dict
Binary: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
